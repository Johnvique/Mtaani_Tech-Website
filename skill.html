      <h5 style="color: "><strong>Code Skills</strong></h5>
            <p>The type of kick one gets from writing code is not one that can be explained by words. Usually, your passion keeps you going despite the many challenges ranging from hindering factors such as bugs and fatigue. Personally, what fascinates me most is the broad extent of diversity in the single field of computing. The flexibility of the profession also makes it the only thing that can satisfy the urge of mystery and fulfill the experience of twists. Think of a scenario where you manipulate the different definitions of syntax and end up completely changing the semantics of various statements. Code gives you the mandate to transform your imaginations into reality.<p><a class="btn btn-info" href="#" role="button">Read more...</a></p>

          <h5 style="color: "><strong>Code Ethics</strong></h5>
          <p>I find computers very easy to relate to or rather interact with in comparison with human beings. Let us look at it in this form, I have trouble initializing conversations. Maybe my buddy here is going through some rough patch and I don't know how they respond to conversations.A conversation between a computer and a PHP developer is very easy. Start any apache/MySQL server and you have your pal ready to communicate. My point is, I've lost some good coders and buddies on the way, perceive the art as some fun thing rather than as some impossible task and trust me, the implication is an infinite loop of achievements within the broad boundaries of ICT.<p><a class="btn btn-info" href="#" role="button">Read more...</a></p>

        <h5 style="color: "><strong>Code Experience</strong></h5>
          <p>If you haven't experienced the kick in writing code, yet you have a passion for adventure, you are missing out on a great deal of adventure. I think of the art of writing code as an awesome sci-fi series in which I am the scriptwriter. In such a case you can define the roles of your characters and deploy the various forms of mysteries to blow the viewers mind. Some describe writing code with reference to the awesome game of chess. Well, they are not wrong since the challenges are numerous. I describe writing code with reference to a sci-fi movie in which you are the scriptwriter. All these perceptions are both true and false. Code is described based on what being part of the cool art makes you feel.<p><a class="btn btn-info" href="#" role="button">Read more...</a></p>
